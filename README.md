# Angular and Spring Boot : Create your first Full Stack App

This repo was born from the Udemy course [(Angular and Spring Boot : Create your first Full Stack App)](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-y-spring-boot-java-crea-tu-primera-app-web-full-stack/) To continue practicing in the Main branch I will leave the project as it was done in the course and in the other branches will go the functionalities that I will practice on my part.
